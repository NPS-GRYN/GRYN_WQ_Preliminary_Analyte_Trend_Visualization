# GRYN_WQ_Preliminary_Analyte_Trend_Visualization
Code base to create figures and allow for preliminary visualization of analyte trends.

To Do and Idea List for this Code:
1. Do we need to download discharge data at all for future analyses?
2. Add in Lab Analytes / Parameters for BICA and YELL (currently only have BICA)
3. Visualize all analyte and location combinations available
     a. Compare a single analyte across all monitoring sites
     b. Compare all analytes across a single monitoring site
5. Comb for outliers and either flag or correct in NPStoret before publishing 2024 data. 
6. Determine a priority list of analytes and sites for future trend analysis.
     a. Some analytes will be <RL too often to have a meaningful sample size.
7. Develop a single page reference guide that we can use when lab data is received.
     a. Allow GRYN to immediately verify the lab data is within expected parameters.
     b. No longer have to input lab data into excel spreadsheet.
